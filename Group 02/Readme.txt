Web Design:
The websites layout, navigation and overall design was discussed and prototyped during the first couple weeks of the project.
The HTML code is structured with a main content div which holds all of the content on the page, excluding header, navigation and footer. Inside of this main content div the actual content is broken into smaller pieces through the use of other divs. This is done for easier positioning and formating of the content on the page. 

Implementation:
The responsive webdesign was done by making the CSS code for the first group assignment only active if viewed on a screen with more than 1024 pixels in width through the use of media query. New CSS code was written for mobile and tablet view. Added a new header which includes navigation in the HTML document which is only visible if viewed on a screen with less than 1024 pixels in width and hides the other header. This second header has seperate CSS code for both Mobile and tablet view.

The webslider was done using Javascript and incorporated into the already existing gallery, hiding the gallery from the first group project which now is only visible on mobile and tablet view. Decided against having an automatic slider so added some big buttons for changing the slides.

Geolocation was also done using Javascript, and incorporated into the already existing contact page, replacing the "map" which was already there. A static marker is placed on a fictional address of Llama Inc. In addition the user is asked whether or not to allow the page to know their location, in which case another marker is added to display the users location. 


During this assignment we used Javascript, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5.
