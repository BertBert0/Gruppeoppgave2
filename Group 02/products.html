					Baby llama wool scarfs</h2>
				<p class="content-text">
					Our scarfs are a perfect match for the classic Llama beanies. Knit in our factory. What's special about these scarfs however is that they're made of 100% baby llama wool. They are available in grey, brown and beige. Have you ever felt the softness of cashmere? That is what the baby llama wool feels like. It will keep you protected against drafts and chills, and it will feel extremely comfortable at the same time. Even though we call it baby llama wool it doesn't necessarily mean that it actually came from a baby llama. Even older llamas are able to produce fiber that falls into the "baby" category. In other words it's just a classification used to describe the group and micron count of the fibers taken from the animal.
